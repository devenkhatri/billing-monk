# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables automatic storage of generated invoices to a specified Google Drive location. When an invoice is generated (either as PDF or other formats), the system will automatically upload and store a copy to the user's configured Google Drive folder, providing backup, accessibility, and integration with existing document management workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want all generated invoices to be automatically stored in my Google Drive, so that I have a centralized backup and can easily access them from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invoice PDF is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically upload a copy to the configured Google Drive folder
2. WHEN the Google Drive upload is successful THEN the system SHALL log the successful storage operation
3. WHEN the Google Drive upload fails THEN the system SHALL retry the upload up to 3 times with exponential backoff
4. IF the Google Drive upload fails after all retries THEN the system SHALL log the failure and continue normal invoice generation without blocking the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure which Google Drive folder my invoices are stored in, so that I can organize them according to my business structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing application settings THEN the system SHALL provide a Google Drive folder configuration option
2. WHEN configuring the Google Drive folder THEN the system SHALL allow browsing and selecting folders from the user's Google Drive
3. WHEN no folder is configured THEN the system SHALL create a default "Invoices" folder in the user's Google Drive root
4. WHEN the configured folder is deleted or inaccessible THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default "Invoices" folder

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with Google Drive securely, so that my invoices can be stored without compromising my account security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up Google Drive integration THEN the system SHALL use OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store only the necessary access tokens securely
3. WHEN access tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them using the refresh token
4. IF token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to re-authenticate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the status of Google Drive storage for each invoice, so that I know whether my invoices have been successfully backed up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing an invoice THEN the system SHALL display the Google Drive storage status (stored, pending, failed, or disabled)
2. WHEN an invoice fails to upload to Google Drive THEN the system SHALL provide a manual retry option
3. WHEN viewing invoice lists THEN the system SHALL show a visual indicator for Google Drive storage status
4. WHEN Google Drive integration is disabled THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this status to the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to enable or disable Google Drive storage, so that I can control whether this feature is active for my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing settings THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle to enable/disable Google Drive storage
2. WHEN Google Drive storage is disabled THEN the system SHALL not attempt to upload any invoices to Google Drive
3. WHEN re-enabling Google Drive storage THEN the system SHALL not retroactively upload previously generated invoices
4. WHEN disabling Google Drive storage THEN the system SHALL retain existing stored invoices but stop new uploads

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want invoices to be stored with meaningful filenames in Google Drive, so that I can easily identify and organize them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing an invoice in Google Drive THEN the system SHALL use the format "Invoice-{invoice_number}-{client_name}-{date}.pdf"
2. WHEN the filename contains invalid characters THEN the system SHALL sanitize them while preserving readability
3. WHEN a file with the same name already exists THEN the system SHALL append a timestamp to avoid conflicts
4. WHEN storing recurring invoices THEN the system SHALL include the recurrence information in the filename
