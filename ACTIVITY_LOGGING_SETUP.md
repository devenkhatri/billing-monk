## Database Schema (Google Sheets)

The `ActivityLogs` sheet includes the following columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| ID | String | Unique identifier |
| Type | String | Activity type (e.g., 'invoice_created') |
| Description | String | Human-readable description |
| EntityType | String | Type of entity affected |
| EntityID | String | ID of the affected entity |
| EntityName | String | Name of the affected entity |
| UserID | String | ID of the user who performed the action |
| UserEmail | String | Email of the user |
| IPAddress | String | IP address of the request |
| UserAgent | String | Browser/client information |
| Amount | Number | Financial amount (if applicable) |
| PreviousValue | String | JSON string of previous state |
| NewValue | String | JSON string of new state |
| Metadata | String | Additional context data (JSON) |
| Timestamp | String | ISO timestamp of when activity occurred |

## Integration Example

Here's how activity logging has been integrated into the clients API:

```typescript
// In src/app/api/clients/route.ts
import { activityLogger } from '@/lib/activity-logger';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  const client = await sheetsService.createClient(createData);
  
  // Log the activity
  await activityLogger.logClientActivity(
    'client_added',
    client.id,
    client.name,
    session.user?.id,
    session.user?.email || undefined,
    undefined,
    client
  );
  
  return client;
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Verify Installation
Run the setup verification script:
```bash
node scripts/setup-activity-logging.js
```

### 2. Initialize Google Sheets
If you haven't already, initialize the sheets structure:
```bash
# Start your application
npm run dev

# Navigate to the initialization endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sheets/initialize
```

### 3. Test the Feature
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/activity-logs`
2. Create a new client or invoice
3. Verify the activity appears in the activity logs

### 4. Add Logging to Existing APIs
To add activity logging to other API endpoints, follow this pattern:

```typescript
import { activityLogger } from '@/lib/activity-logger';

// After successful operation
await activityLogger.logInvoiceActivity(
  'invoice_created',
  invoice.id,
  invoice.invoiceNumber,
  invoice.total,
  userId,
  userEmail
);
```

- Pagination implemented to handle large datasets
- Filtering applied server-side to reduce data transfer

### Asynchronous Logging
- Activity logging is non-blocking
- Failed logging attempts don't break main functionality
- Error handling prevents cascading failures

### Storage Optimization
- JSON serialization for complex data structures
- Efficient column structure in Google Sheets
- Automatic cleanup recommendations

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor activity log volume and performance
- Review and archive old activity logs periodically
- Update activity types as new features are added
- Monitor for suspicious activities

### Troubleshooting
- Check Google Sheets permissions if logging fails
- Verify API authentication for activity log access
- Monitor browser console for client-side errors
- Review server logs for API endpoint issues

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Real-time activity notifications
- Activity log export functionality
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with external audit systems
- Automated cleanup and archiving
- Activity log dashboards and visualizations

## Support

1. Check the troubleshooting sections in the documentation
2. Verify setup using the setup script
3. Review browser console and server logs
4. Check Google Sheets permissions and connectivity

## Conclusion

The Activity Logging feature is now fully implemented and ready for use. It provides comprehensive audit trails, security monitoring, and operational insights for your billing system. The feature is designed to be non-intrusive, performant, and compliant with audit requirements.

All components are properly integrated and documented, making it easy to maintain and extend the functionality as needed.
